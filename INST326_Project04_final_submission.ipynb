    "1. Improving / simplifying / combining the note and snippet formats\n",

    "    1. Make the window larger\n",
    "    2. Add scroll bars and other widgets to the notes display\n",

    "6. Add snippet copy functionality so that snippets may be copied and pasted into programs\n",
    "7. Add search functionality for your notes\n",
    "8. Create a note share repository on github to share notes with other groups\n",
    "9. Improve the save and read notebooks functionality to accomodate notebooks in different formats (txt, json, csv, xml)\n",
    "10. create a utility program to convert notes from one format to another\n",
